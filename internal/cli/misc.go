package cli

// Commands that remain in bash (stubs for help completeness)
// These are complex interactive commands better suited to shell scripting

// Implemented commands (in their own files):
// newDiffCmd is now in diff.go
// newDoctorCmd is now in doctor.go
// newDriftCmd is now in drift.go
// newEncryptCmd is now in encrypt.go
// newLintCmd is now in lint.go
// newMetricsCmd is now in metrics.go
// newPackagesCmd is now in packages.go
// newSetupCmd is now in setup.go
// newSyncCmd is now in sync.go
// newUninstallCmd is now in uninstall.go

// Dropped from Go CLI:
// migrate - one-time v2→v3 migration, users on v3 don't need it

// Note: All CLI commands are implemented in Go
